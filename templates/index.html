                Diabetes is the most common chronic diseases affecting people and the rates are continuously rising around the world. It's a chronic metabolic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood, and the onset can often be influenced by factors like genetics, obesity, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy diet. Three main types of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Diabetes, particularly Type 2 Diabetes, poses a significant public health concern in Canada due to its growing prevalence and its associated health complications. The international Diabetes Federation has listed Canada as one of the worst OECD countries for Diabetes prevalence. One in every 3 Canadian has diabetes or prediabetes and one Canadian is diagnosed with diabetes every 3 minutes. As of 2022, about 11 million Canadians are estimated to be living with diabetes or prediabetes, a figure expected to rise in the coming years.

          <P>The increasing prevalence of diabetes in Canada has profound implications, not only for those affected but also for the healthcare system and the broader economy. According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, diabetes cost the Canadian healthcare system about $3.8 billion in 2020, a figure expected to rise due to increasing prevalence. These costs are tied to hospitalizations, medications, physician visits, and managing diabetes-related complications. A report by Diabetes Canada from 2022, indicated that majority of Canadians pay more than 3% of their income or over $1,500 per year for prescribed medications, devices and supplies out-of-pocket. It's also worth noting that individuals living with diabetes often incur substantial out-of-pocket expenses related to medications, supplies, and other health services, which can impose a significant financial burden.<br><br>

            In addition to direct healthcare costs, there are considerable indirect costs associated with diabetes. Productivity loss due to absenteeism and work disability, early retirement, and premature mortality all contribute to the economic burden of diabetes. Moreover, the impact of diabetes extends beyond financial considerations. The disease can severely affect individuals' quality of life, limit their daily activities, and lead to emotional and psychological distress. Given the multifaceted impacts of diabetes, preventing its onset and managing its progression are crucial.<br><br>
            
            The direct cost of Diabetes to the health care system is the highest in Ontario compared to the other provinces in Canada, followed by British Columba and Alberta.Ontario spends nearly $1 billion annually for treatment of diabetes and its complications. The Direct cost to the health care system in Ontario was 1.7 billion for 2022, and it is expected to rise considering the anticipated rise in the number of people developing diabetes.

        <h1>What Is Needed</h1>
        <p>
          The experience of other countries provides valuable lessons. For instance, Finland's National Diabetes Prevention Program (FIN-D2D) has successfully reduced the incidence of diabetes by implementation of preventative approach. This initiative involved strategies like increased screening, treatment, lifestyle interventions through healthy diet and physical activity, awareness among the population and health care providers and intersectoral collaboration. A similar approach, adjusted for the specific context, could be beneficial in Ontario and other parts of Canada. 
          </p>
          <div class="image">
            <img src="/static/css/n.png" class="">
          </div>
          <p>
            The aim of the program was to identify high risk subjects in the population by asking them to fill out the Finnish Diabetes Risk score which comprised of 8 scored question indicating the probability of developing Type 2 diabetes. This score could be completed at pharmacies, on the internet, at various public campaign events to get more people involved. And depending on ther scores, they were followed up with written material or referral to life-style intervention programs. The programs were also taylored considering the patient centered approach. The strategies were evaluated to measure the effectiveness of the program. A similar Canada Diabetes Risk Questionair (CANRISK) has been developed. It is adapted from FINDRISC, after consulting The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC),group of clinical and academic experts and modifying it to accurately reflect the diabetes risk applicable to Canadians, by adding new questions on ethnicity, education and gestational diabetes. A study published in 2022 to evaluate the implementation of the CANRISK tool, identified that the tool was used widely by allied health professionals, appealing and needed to assess the risk for developing Diabetes, however, there were certain barriers to implementation such as readability, confusing language and difficulty ascertaining body measurements. Improvement in the content, design and accessibility was recommended. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1499267121001799)<br><br>

A peer reviewed article about health care cost in Canada indicated that population intervention (5% body weight reduction) and individual level risk reduction (10% reduction in the high risk groups) would save several million dollars in health care costs. (https://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/hpcdp-pspmc/37-2/assets/pdf/ar-03-eng.pdf)<br><br>

In British Columbia, the Live 5-2-1-0 initiative encourages children to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables, have no more than two hours of screen time, engage in at least one hour of physical activity, and consume zero sugary drinks every day.<br><br>

Similarly, coordinated and comprehensive efforts and rapid knowledge sharing are needed to address the complex issues around diabetes. The strategies should target specific outcomes against which progress can be measured to ensure efficacy and accountability. The strategies should be aligned with the principles of health equity and developed considering the requirements specific to the vulnerable communities and subgroups and should have a patient centered approach. <br><br>

Based on available evidence, strategies focusing on prevention and early detection and treatment through lifestyle changes can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes and diabetes related complications. Such interventions could involve multi-diciplinary but integrated programs promoting healthier eating, regular physical activity, and weight management. These interventions can be delivered through various settings, including schools, workplaces, and community centers. However, these interventions need to be adapted to the local context to be effective. With adequate knowledge and awareness, people will be able to appreciate the benefits of healthy lifestyle and good nutrition. <br><br>

Screening for diabetes should be done every 3 years in individuals >40 years of age or at high risk using a risk calculator and even more frequently for people at very high risk using a risk calculator. The CANRISK questionnaire should be made easily available for people to access their risk. Knowing their risk will increase awareness and help people make healthy choices in order to reduce their risk or even prevent them from developing diabetes. <br><br>

Mental health support should be provided to end stigma and help increase their sense of well-being. <br><br>

Patients living with Diabetes should have improved access to treatment, medications, devices, life-style modification groups/ programs and regular follow-up to manage their diabetes. <br><br>

Similarly, emphaisis should be laid on choosing healthy diet (eating fruits and vegetables) and physical activity in children and youth. Improved care for students with Type 1 diabetes by reducing stigma, improved access to drugs, devices and technology and research. <br><br>

An essential aspect of preventing diabetes is addressing the social determinants of health, such as income, education, employment, and social support networks. Policies and programs aimed at improving these determinants can contribute significantly to preventing diabetes. For example, policies that support affordable housing and access to healthy food and restricting marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages can help reduce the risk of diabetes among low-income individuals. <br><br>

Stretegies should be developed considering unique concerns of indigenous poeple, prioritizing health, wellness and cultural safety, hence should be developed involving indigenous groups. These strategies should address disparities of health and determinants of health.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
              Given the rising incidence of diabetes and its significant impact on individuals and society, it's crucial to prioritize diabetes prevention and management in Canada. The government at all levels should increase funding for public health interventions, such as community-based lifestyle modification programs and health education campaigns. In addition, stricter regulations on food labeling and advertising, along with taxes on sugary beverages, could help reduce the consumption of unhealthy food and drink. However, there are potential challenges in implementing these strategies. These include resistance from industries affected by the changes and the inherent difficulty in changing lifestyle behaviors on a population-wide scale. Furthermore, the socioeconomic disparities in diabetes prevalence highlight the need to address the broader social determinants of health. Policies that reduce income inequality, improve education, and ensure access to health services and healthy food are crucial.In conclusion, addressing the diabetes epidemic in Canada requires a comprehensive, multi-level approach that goes beyond healthcare. It involves health policies, social policies, community initiatives, and individual behavior change. Despite the challenges, such an approach can significantly improve the health and well-being of Canadians, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance societal productivity.
